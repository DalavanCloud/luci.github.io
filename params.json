{"name":"LUCI","tagline":"Open Source Continuous Integration that Scales :)","body":"### Welcome to LUCI.\r\n\r\nLUCI stands for Layered \"Universal\" Continuous Integration. It's a fleet of complementary, but independent, scalable services made to facilitate small-to-huge-scale CI needs. In particular, it's designed to provide a robust foundation of distributed computation on top of which you can layer your own build scripts.\r\n\r\nThe \"Universal\" is in quotes because it means \"Highly Adaptable\" (as in, a \"universal screwdriver\"), as opposed to \"Fits Poorly for Everything\" (as in, a \"universal remote\").\r\n\r\nThere's nothing to see here yet, but stay tuned :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
